# Pandas Challenge - PyCitySchools
### Objective
Develop a code using python and pandas to analyze Py City Schools' district-wide standardized test results and create summary tables to highlight trends in school performance. 

### Description of the Data: schools_complete and students_complete
Overall descriptive metricts for each school in Py City are contained in a csv file called "schools_complete". The dataset is organized into five columns: 
- School ID - the ID number for each school in the city
- School Name - the name of each school in the city
- Type - the school's type (either charter or district)
- Size - the number of students attending each school
- Budget - the budget for each individual school

The data for each student attending a Py City school are contained in a csv file called "students_complete". The dataset is organized into seven columns:
- Student ID - the ID number for each student in the city 
- Student Name - the name of each student in the city
- Gender - each student's gender (male or female)
- Grade - the grade each student is in (9th to 12th grade)
- School Name - the name of the school the student attends
- Reading Score - the student's numeric score (out of 100) on their standardized reading test
- Math Score - the student's numeric score (out of 100) on their standardized math test
